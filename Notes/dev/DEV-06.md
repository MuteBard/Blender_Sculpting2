## Subdivision Modifier vs the Multresolution Modifier

    At first glace they appear to do the same exact thing, but one thing that the Muliresolution modifier (multires-mod) has over the subdivision modifier (sub-mod) is that when use the sub-mod and then go to sculpt mode, the base geometry and its original verticies are still present. You cannot sculpt the
    geometry too effectively due to the lack of geometry.

## What is Topology?
    Topology is the flow and stucture of the 3D mesh, which creates the
    shape of our 3d model.

    Good topology means to place vertices, edges and faces in a clean and efficient way to represent the shape of our 3D model with as few polygons as possible and in a way that allows proper deformation of the mesh

## Why only quads?

    Whe using quads it is much easier to create a smooth looking surface.
    with tri and ngons it can come to ugly artifacts.

    When using tris or ngons, its reccomended to only use them on flat surfaces

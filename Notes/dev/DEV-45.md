## Cloth tools
    Initially when working with cloth tools, you want to have low subdivisions
    Otherwise you will get tiny folds that you might not intend for.

    Next we only want to apply this filter to the sides that dont have facesets.
    This is a type of masking feature

## Applying the tools
    Like the mesh filter, drag the mouse to the right until you felt that it inflates to the degree that you like

    Then do a subdivide in the multires modifier so that you can add more folds
    afterwards

    Then mask little areas so that they will not be affected by the brush

    Switch between subdivisions to vary the degree of the folds
    I switch between 2 and 3 to get the folds I want
